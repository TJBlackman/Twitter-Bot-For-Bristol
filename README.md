A basic twitter bot I built for my dog who had a cone on after surgery! 

You will need to add a config.js file with your own API keys to get it to run.

I actually followed a tutorial to build this, which was insanely simple. Basically plug in API keys and you're half done. I then made some tiny customizations and wrote a few lines of code to get it to post pics, and that was it.
